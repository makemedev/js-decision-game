    INTERACTIVE LOGIC GAME
    Build a game where a user gets presented decisions and, based on the user's choice, a storyline of your choosing develops.
    Requirements:  
    1. Use the `window.prompt` and/or `window.confirm` method to let users make decisions in your story.
    3. Users should have to make at least 3 decisions. Each decision should affect the outcome of your story.
    4. Upon the final decision, Your html page should update, displaying the result of the user's decisions. 
        - There is a div with the id `result` in the html document. 
        - Create an html element containing the game's result (text) and add the element as a child to #result
        - Once your result is appended to the DOM, target #result, remove the .hide class, 
            and add the .fade-in-up class to see the user's result appear on the screen.
